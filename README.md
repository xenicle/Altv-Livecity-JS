# Altv Livecity JS
 JS Traffic synchronization fork from b2soft proof-of-concept - alt:V Multiplayer

This alt:V Multiplayer resource is a rewrite and small enhancement of https://github.com/b2soft/altv-livecity, it's still a proof-of-concept but feel free to use all or parts of it.

<h1>Install:</h1>

Place "livecity-js" folder in alt:V resources folder and add "livecity-js" string to resources section of server.toml.

Install dependencies `npm i xml-js msgpack5`

For now work correctly on alt:V Server 16.1.2-rc.1 (rc)
